## Homework 5

The deadline for Homework 5 is Friday, October 20, 6pm. The late submission deadline is Tuesday, October 24, 4pm.

Refer to the homework handout [`hw05.pdf`](hw05.pdf) for details about the assignment. This file provides some information to help you get started with setting up your development environment for the homework assignments.

### Getting the code template

Before you perform the next steps, you first need to create your own
private copy of this git repository. To do so, click on the link
provided in the announcement of this homework assignment on
Brightspace. After clicking on the link, you will receive an email from
GitHub, when your copy of the repository is ready. It will be
available at
`https://github.com/nyu-popl-fa23/hw05-<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>`.
Note that this may take a few minutes.

* Open a browser at `https://github.com/nyu-popl-fa23/hw05-<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>` with your Github username inserted at the appropriate place in the URL.
* Choose a place on your computer for your homework assignments to reside and open a terminal to that location.
* Execute the following git command: <br/>
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/nyu-popl-fa23/hw05-<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>.git hw05
  cd hw05
  ```

Please make sure that you clone the copy of your own version of this repository that is identified by your Github username, rather than the template repository.

The problems that you you should solve for this assignment are described in the file `hw05.pdf`.

Your solutions to the assignment should be either put in a plain text file called `solution.md`, or a PDF file called `solution.pdf`. Scans of clearly readable hand-written solutions are also accepted. Please stick to this naming scheme.

There is no coding part for this assignment.

### Submitting your solution

Once you have completed the assignment, you can submit your solution
by pushing the modified code template to GitHub. This can be done by
opening a terminal in the project's root directory and executing the
following commands in the terminal:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "solution"
git push
```

You can replace "solution" by a more meaningful commit message.

Refresh your browser window pointing at
```
https://github.com/nyu-popl-fa23/hw05-<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/
```
and double-check that your solution has been uploaded correctly.

You can resubmit an updated solution anytime by reexecuting the above
git commands. Though, please remember the rules for submitting
solutions after the homework deadline has passed.
